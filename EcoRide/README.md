ðŸŒ¿ EcoRide Buddy â€” Share Rides. Save Money. Save the Planet.

Tagline: Connect with nearby riders for carpooling, bike-sharing, and eco-friendly shared trips â€” reduce travel costs and carbon emissions together.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

EcoRide Buddy is a responsive, front-end web platform (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+) that helps commuters find and share eco-friendly rides. Users can post rides, search and filter listings, join rides, save favorites, and track their personal eco-impact (COâ‚‚ saved) â€” all stored locally using localStorage for persistence. The UI is modern, friendly, and community-driven, using soft greens, blues, and subtle animations.
