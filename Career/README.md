üöÄ CareerQuest ‚Äî Gamified Career Path Explorer

Tagline: Turn career exploration into a playful, guided journey ‚Äî discover paths, track progress, earn badges, and build your future one milestone at a time.

‚ú® Project Summary

CareerQuest is a responsive, front-end web application built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+) that transforms career discovery into a gamified experience. Users orbit animated career icons on the homepage, explore detailed roadmaps for each career, save and track a personalized journey using localStorage, take a career quiz, browse curated resources, collect achievement badges, and engage with community tips and inspiration.

This project focuses on strong UI/UX (soft glowing effects, pastel palettes, subtle animations), clean code structure, and DOM-driven interactivity so it can be scaled to frameworks or backed by APIs later.
